# FN-eyeblink

In this repository, I provide all matlab codes for all analysis in my paper 'A FN-MdV Pathway and Its Role in Cerebellar Multimodular Control of Sensorimotor Behavior' published in Nature Communications (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19960-x). Please cite the paper if you use codes in your work.

We used Matlab2017a and Matlab2014a to perform all the analysis in a Windows10 system. 

Most of the inputs, outputs are described in the codes correspondingly. Variables should be justified in line with coding.
